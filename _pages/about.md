My name is Sebastian Lee; I am a first-year machine learning PhD student in [Claudia Clopath's lab](http://www.bg.ic.ac.uk/research/c.clopath/) at Imperial College London. I am interested in the intersection between neuroscience and machine learning, specifically in relation to the paradigms of reinforcement learning, continual learning and meta-learning.

Previously I did my undergraduate degree in theoretical physics (also at Imperial), and my master's in computer science at the University of Oxford where my research was under the supervision of Andrew Saxe and Sebastian Goldt. I have also been an AI resident at Microsoft Research in Cambridge and an AI/ML intern at Apple. 

Feel free to reach out to me at _user_ @ ic.ac.uk where _user_ is __sal14__.
